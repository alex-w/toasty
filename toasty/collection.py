"""
Collections of related input images.

Some Toasty processing tasks operate over collections of input images that are
related in some way. This module provides standardized mechanisms for
manipulating such collections. In particular, it provides a framework for
scanning over image "descriptions" without reading in the complete image data.
This can be useful because many collection-related operations want to do an
initial pass over the collection to gather some global information, then a
second pass with the actual data processing.
